May 9,

Conditions: Approximately 52 degrees Fahrenheit, limited visibility in the dark, cold earthen floor.

Day 7: It has been a week now, meaning two weeks since my foolhardy daughter thought to take on this venture alone.

Three times now I've come across markings on the wall that must have been hers. Why she only chose to begin tracing her steps after so much time is beyond me.

Why she has stopped again and again keeps me moving. She's a bright girl, but I still fear for her as a father.

I grow weary walking these halls. I hope to find her soon, I expect this will be my last exploration.
