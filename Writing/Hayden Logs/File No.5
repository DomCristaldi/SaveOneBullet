One month since exploring this maze, and it still amazes me.

They remind her of the pyramids we explored together, ever expanding into the depths.

I would wonder of the people who built it, and the technology they must possess.

She would marvel at the beauty of their creation.

She would worry too. For her father's aching back and weary legs. He couldn't explore this whole place alone.
