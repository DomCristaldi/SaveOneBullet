Ugh, I can't believe him!  

Why can't Father understand!  The Labyrinth is extremely dangerous; countless people have gone missing trying to explore it!  

Then again, that's exactly why he would explore it.  Father loves danger, and excitement, and mystery - that's why he's an archaeologist, after all.  

But even the great Professor Hayden Robertson, explorer of over a hundred temples, gets old.  Just the other day he nearly fell down the stairs; what if he hurts himself during an exploration, let alone in the Labyrinth?  It's far too dangerous for him to go, and I won't let him.  

I'm sorry Father, but it's for your own good.
