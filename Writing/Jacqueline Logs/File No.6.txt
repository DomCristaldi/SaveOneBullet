Conditions: Air is approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit, Viewing conditions are bright, Passageways have a mudlike floor

The Labyrinth has altered itself again.  It has shifted from passageways intersecting at 90 degree angles to curved corners; as a result, transcription of progress has grown more difficult.  

The walls of the Labyrinth have begun bearing messages, likely left by prior explorers.  They contain such heartening messages as "There is no escape", "THE WALLS ARE ALIVE", and "BEWARE THE SHROUDS". 

I am quite curious as to what these "Shrouds" are.  Are they organisms spawned by the Labyrinth?  Other explorers driven mad through isolation?  Or perhaps, merely the vagaries of a shattered mind?  

Despite the various remnants of supplies and scraps of messages I have discovered, none of them are indicative of who I am searching for.  

Oh, you foolish girl?  Why did you go into the Labyrinth?
