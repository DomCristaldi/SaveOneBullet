How is there snow here?  

Just yesterday, it was broiling hot; I even had to take off my shirt from the heat.  Maybe it's fake, like the berries from three days ago.  Wait, wasn't it five days ago?  

I'm not sure how long I've been down here.  

There's still no sign of Father, and I've lost the way out.  Just yesterday - or was it today - I went back to try a different path, but there was only a dead end.  I could've sworn there was a bridge there only moments ago.  

There was a bridge, right?  

Father... I'm scared.
