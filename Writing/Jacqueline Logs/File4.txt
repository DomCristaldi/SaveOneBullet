Get a hold of yourself!  

Observe.  Record.  Analyze.  Act.  Those are the four tenets of exploration.  Father wouldn't lose control so easily, so neither can I!  

I must keep my wits about me, and take note of everything that changes and everything that stays the same.  As Father's daughter, I won't lose myself so easily!  

First, analyze the conditions of the Labyrinth.  The air is approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and viewing conditions are clear.  Passageways appear normal.  

Deliberate and methodical movement will take me through this Labyrinth.  I'll find you, I swear.
