Everything's dark now.  It's foggy, and it's cold, and I can't even see my own feet.  

There are weird noises, and screams and rattles.  I should've listened to Preston.  I never should've gone in this stupid Labyrinth!  

I saw something really scary.  Someone wrote on one of the walls in something red.  I really hope it wasn't blood.  

All it said was "Beware the Shadows".  What do they mean by Shadows?  

It's really cold now, and I'm starving.  I miss Preston.  I miss my bed, and pizza, and TV, and my house.  

I miss my Mom.
