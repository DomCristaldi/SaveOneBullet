The others are fools.  

How could they flee so easily?  Do they not comprehend the sheer value of the treasure that this Labyrinth holds?  

They are worse than cowards.  They are fools.  

Well, it is for the best, I suppose.  After all, the treasure is now mine and mine alone.  

It is I, the greatest being of our time, the most transcendent existence of our era, the most peerless mind to have ever graced the very Earth that will obtain this Labyrinth's spoils!  

I, the great Alexander LeRoux will be the victor!
