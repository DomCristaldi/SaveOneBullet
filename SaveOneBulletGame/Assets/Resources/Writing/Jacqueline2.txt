I never should have yelled at Father like that.  

Still, I was so worried about him!  His health isn't what it used to be, and there's no way he'd be capable of exploring the Labyrinth at his age!  

I can't believe he went in on his own like that!  I have to find him; it's my fault he went in here.  

It's been over a week since I went in here, and I still haven't found a sign of him.  This place is unsettling... 

There's something off about the Labyrinth.
