May 3,

Conditions: Approximately 63 degrees Fahrenheit, clear viewing conditions, and a stone floor.

Day 2: The search continues today, as laborious as it had been the day prior. These tunnels are dark, though not so dark I can't find my way. 

Thus far I have made do following the tunnels deeper, holding fast to the right wall; marking it as I go. If only my daughter had thought to do the same.

It is unlikely I'll catch her today, my old bones are weary. She undoubtedly moves faster than I do; still I must press on. 

Oh, you foolish little girl, where did you go off to?
