May 12,

Conditions: 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the air is wet here, and the walls slimy, but it is unnaturally warm. 

Yesterday I heard a voice call out from behind me, and as I backtracked I discovered not only that I was still alone, but that the hall I had noted earlier did not exist.

I fear this darkness is doing things to my mind. I must remain diligent or lose myself in these halls.

I pray my daughter is close.
