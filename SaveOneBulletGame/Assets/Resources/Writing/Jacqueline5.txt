As ludicrous as it seems, it's begun to rain in the Labyrinth.  The chambers appear to be capable of their own weather systems.  Furthermore, bioluminescent moss has begun to grow on the walls, providing a dull green glow to the chambers.  

I retraced my steps for the last hour with my left hand on the wall, and the results are undeniable.  

The Labyrinth is constantly changing.  

What was once a polished wall of black marble lit with braziers set at consistent intervals is now a wall of rough brick lined with moss.  Furthermore, there is a new pathway where there was once a dead end.  

The conditions of the Labyrinth are constantly shifting.  I fear finding that person will be more difficult than ever.
