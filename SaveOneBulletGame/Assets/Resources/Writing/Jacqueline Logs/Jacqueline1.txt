It's been three days since I've entered the Labyrinth.  

It's very expansive - that much is undeniable - but I've managed to cover a lot of ground so far.  I still haven't found any sign of Father, though; where could he be?  

He's far too old for this sort of thing, and I told him not to, but he just wouldn't listen!  

I'll find him though, I have to.  And when I do, I'll yell his ears off for making Mom and I worry!
