This Labyrinth is a formidable foe.  

However, it is no match for me!  I've etched my family crest onto the walls as I've traveled, ensuring my path. 

The much-vaunted hazards of the Labyrinth were mere trifles.  Rotting rope bridges?  Spiked floors and darts firing from the walls?  

Droll cliches.  

There is one thing I have yet to encounter, however.  Scraps of torn fabric, yellowed sheets of paper, desperate inscriptions scrawled in blood on the walls - each say the same thing.  

Beware the Shrouds.
