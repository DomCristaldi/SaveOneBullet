Conditions: 65 degrees Fahrenheit - As I travel further I believe these notes become more unnecessary. These tunnels are inconsistent, and my daughter would not take note of them.

I taught her everything she knows, whether she makes use of it or not. I know how she would approach these halls. She's stubborn like her mother.

She would press on, and not fret over herself. She always favoured turning right.

If I am to find her, I must follow the halls as she would, not as I would.
