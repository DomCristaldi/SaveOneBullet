I ran into a wraith today; a shadowy skeletal figure lumbering through the halls.

Nothing I've seen before could prepare me for it. No training I've received explain what to do before monsters like that. So I ran.

I may have been only a minute away, but I couldn't find my way back even if I tried.

I may never find my father. I never should have ignored him. He knew I wasn't ready.
